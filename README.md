# My iOS Projects

## AR Experience

AR Experience app is created to learn the way how the Reality Kit works. I hacked the UI programmatically with UIKit. We need to add ARKit to the required device capabilities section in the info. Firstly created the 3D object modal. I choosed to create a sphere that is red and metallic. I added an anchor point to my model. Lastly I added my anchor point to scene. The app can work with only the real devices. It is not supported to work with the simulators. The app needs to access to the device's camera.
